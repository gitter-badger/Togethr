Togethr
=======

Togethr is an open-source project that aims to increase access to care for the 73% of students who experience a mental health crisis during college. Of the 2.2 million students who sought counseling in 2012, 41% reported difficulty receiving treatment because of long waits and inconvenient services. 

Our Rails-based platform will offer a solution for the 88% of campuses that do not have the staff to accomodate the increasing number of students seeking help. We will provide virtual (text and video-based) counseling as well as convenient scheduling for in-person sessions. While students are on a waitlist, they will be able to text-chat anonymously with peers who are in a similar situation for immediate support. 

While students will have the option of having their identity be anonymous on the platform, requiring that students log in with a .edu email address will ensure the integrity of our users.
