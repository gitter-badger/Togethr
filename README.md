Togethr
=======

**Togethr (working title) is an open source project that provides college students with virtual mental health counseling and support. 

The lack of sufficient mental healthcare resources on college campuses is a serious issue. Of the 2.2 million students who sought counseling in 2012, 41% reported difficulty receiving treatment because of long waits and inconvenient services. In fact, 88% of campuses do not have the staff to accommodate the increasing number of students seeking help (American College Health Association).

Togethr aims to use technology to increase access to care for the 73% of students who experience a mental health crisis during college (National Alliance on Mental Illness). 

Specifically, our Rails-based platform will offer virtual (text and video-based) counseling as well as convenient scheduling for in-person sessions. While students are on a waitlist, they will be able to text-chat anonymously with peers who are in a similar situation for immediate support. 

While students will have the option of having their identity be anonymous on the platform, requiring that students log in with a .edu email address will ensure the integrity of our users.
